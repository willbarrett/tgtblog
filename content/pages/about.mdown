# About

I'm Will Barrett. This is my blog. It's built using [Nesta](http://nestacms.com), a Ruby CMS.

I'm a Web Developer. I work for [Schafer|Condon|Carter](http://www.schafercondoncarter.com), an advertising agency in the West Loop neighborhood of Chicago. I live in Evanston, right by my favorite coffee shop, [Brothers K](http://www.brotherskcoffee.com/).

You can find my code on [Github](http://github.com/tallgreentree).
